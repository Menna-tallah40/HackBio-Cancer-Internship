# **Introduction**

The TP53 protein plays a crucial role in tumor suppression and is involved in the cellular response to various stressors and the preservation of genomic integrity. TP53 is the most often found genetic mutation in human cancer, which serves as an example of its significance in tumor prevention (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). TP53 tumor suppressor is activated by various cellular stressors like oncogene activation, DNA damage, hypoxia, metabolic dysfunction, and replicative stress. It acts as a transcription factor, controlling gene transcription, and triggering cellular reactions like DNA repair, cell senescence, apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, metabolic modifications, and alterations in cellular properties, including differentiation status. To stop tumor development, TP53 activates genes that control important cellular functions, such as mRNA, miRNA, and lincRNAs. Its complicated tumor-suppressor action involves several effector pathways cooperating in different situations. Senescence and cell cycle arrest, for example, depend on the TP53-regulated gene CDKN1A (p21) (Aubrey et al., 2016).


# **TP53 as a Biomarker in Cancer**

The TP53 gene is mutated in 50% of human cancer cases, with 80% being missense mutations. These mutations create a stable, full-length protein that accumulates in cancer cells. Some mutations alter tumor-suppressive pathways by acting as dominant negatives of the wild-type (Kennedy & Lowe, 2022).  Somatic TP53 mutations are found in nearly all cancer types, with frequencies ranging from 38%–50% in lung, head and neck, ovarian, esophageal, and colorectal cancers to around 5% in cervical cancers, sarcoma, primary leukemia, malignant melanoma, and testicular. So, when comparing distinct tumor cell clusters from the same lesion or several lesions emerging in the same tissue in individual patients, TP53 mutations are helpful biomarkers of tumor clonality; and in the early diagnosis of several cancers (Olivier et al., 2010).


# **Case Study in Cancer Therapy**

An independent indicator of the growth of bladder cancer is nuclear overexpression of the p53 protein. In T1 bladder cancers, nuclear accumulation of mutant p53 has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker and a predictor of clinical response to intravenous bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment. Furthermore, p53 over-expression and an increased risk of pT1 NMIBC development have been linked in a meta-analysis of 12 trials involving 712 individuals, particularly in T1G3 patients receiving intravesical BCG therapy (Ciccarese et al., 2017).


# **Conclusion**

In conclusion, TP53 mutations have a major effect on the onset and spread of cancer, and they are essential indicators for tumor clonality and early detection. Their function in forecasting therapeutic response highlights the promise of TP53 in personalized cancer treatment approaches.
